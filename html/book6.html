        <p>"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" by J.K. Rowling introduces readers to Harry Potter, an orphaned boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that he is a wizard. Raised by his unkind aunt and uncle, Harry learns that he has been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

            At Hogwarts, Harry makes friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and uncovers a magical world filled with wondrous creatures, spells, and mysteries.
