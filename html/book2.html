        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>"To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee is a classic novel set in the American South during the 1930s. The story is narrated by Scout Finch, a young girl growing up in the town of Maycomb, Alabama. Through her eyes, the novel explores themes of racial injustice, moral growth, and the loss of innocence.

            Scout's father, Atticus Finch, is a lawyer who is appointed to defend Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Despite clear evidence of Tom's innocence, he is convicted due to the deep-seated racism of the time. Throughout the trial, Scout and her brother, Jem, witness the prejudice and hatred that pervades their community, while also learning important lessons about empathy, courage, and integrity from their father.
            
            The novel also touches on the mysterious figure of Boo Radley, a reclusive neighbor who becomes a source of fascination for Scout, Jem, and their friend Dill. Over time, they come to understand Boo's kindness and bravery, challenging their initial assumptions about him.
            
            Ultimately, "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a powerful commentary on the moral complexities of human behavior, the impact of racism, and the importance of standing up for what is right, even in the face of overwhelming opposition.</p>
